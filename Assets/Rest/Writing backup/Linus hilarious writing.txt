it's been so long since I saw a square. i'm not even sure i know what they look like anymore. I find my mind adrift, dreaming, trying to remember the blocks. I don't think I have long. My supplies are running low, I've resorted to eating rocks.

it is only in moments like these, I believe, that one can truly appreciate what one had. faced with the knowledge of unending emptiness. the only worldly possession being the mind, once overflowing with opportunities, reduced to web-filled shed in the far end of the garden. 

I may not have long. but the blocks I've seen, the memories I've made, will last me an eternity. If only I could take one last breath in the blooming meadows of Minecraft...
